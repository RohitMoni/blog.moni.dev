I can think of a few from examples of software versioning I’ve seen in the products and tools I use. I’ve come up with my own short-hand terms for each requirement so I can refer to them easier later on. I’ve also provided examples. Chronology You want to be able to tell when one version is newer or older than another. Ex: Windows 10 is newer ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Your Data is Wrong</title><link href="https://blog.moni.dev/posts/your-data-is-wrong/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Your Data is Wrong" /><published>2021-02-23T20:00:00-05:00</published> <updated>2021-02-24T20:00:00-05:00</updated> <id>https://blog.moni.dev/posts/your-data-is-wrong/</id> <content src="https://blog.moni.dev/posts/your-data-is-wrong/" /> <author> <name>Rohit Moni</name> </author> <summary> I’ve come to the conclusion that when you’re building a software product, your data model will be wrong. Not that it is wrong right now (it might be), but that it will be wrong eventually. For one, your data model and structure is probably wrong right now: most teams work with constraints and are human; they make mistakes. But let’s say for the sake of the argument that you’re different, you k... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Stock Options and Me</title><link href="https://blog.moni.dev/posts/stock-options-and-me/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Stock Options and Me" /><published>2020-12-29T13:57:00-05:00</published> <updated>2020-12-29T14:10:00-05:00</updated> <id>https://blog.moni.dev/posts/stock-options-and-me/</id> <content src="https://blog.moni.dev/posts/stock-options-and-me/" /> <author> <name>Rohit Moni</name> </author> <summary> I’m an employee of a (now) public company and I have stock options (like many other people). I was thinking one day about what I should do to maximise my gain from those options and realised something interesting. First, I should note that my situation is specific to me and I’m in Canada, so I’m going with that in mind. I’ll lay down the assumptions I make because of that and you can probably ... </summary> </entry> <entry><title>Setting Up This Blog</title><link href="https://blog.moni.dev/posts/setting-up-this-blog/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Setting Up This Blog" /><published>2020-12-20T12:33:00-05:00</published> <updated>2020-12-20T13:45:00-05:00</updated> <id>https://blog.moni.dev/posts/setting-up-this-blog/</id> <content src="https://blog.moni.dev/posts/setting-up-this-blog/" /> <author> <name>Rohit Moni</name> </author> <summary> Blogging is an interesting phenomenon. To some extent, I’ve always known it’s important to try and blog (get your name out and all that), but I’ve never been able to keep it regular; For some reason it’s always seemed like too much effort. Recently, I’ve seen more blogs on places like reddit that are super simple. Short posts, to the point, not much fluff. They’re mostly text too, but are form... </summary> </entry> </feed>
