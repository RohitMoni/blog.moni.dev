I've started blogs a few different times and have shut them all down. As they say, if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.

I think that I'll do better this time. I have lots to think about and writing is probably the best way to really organize and concretize my thoughts.

Blogging is also something I think I'd be interested in doing when I'm bored. Will write about why I'm probably going to be bored a lot as another post.

As a tentative, maybe too ambitious goal: I want to write about something once a week, every week, for 2025.

Time to get started.
