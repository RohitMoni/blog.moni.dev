title: "Employee Stock Options Strategies"
---

If you're an employee with stock options (like a lot of software people out there) there's an interesting thing to think about that can make you more money. When is the best time to exercise vested stock options? And when is the best time to sell the vested shares?

I did the math for this and came up with a conclusion that surprised me, it might surprise you too.

*Note*: All of my math was done with the Canadian system in mind, because I live and work in Canada. Your mileage may vary depending on where you are because tax (and even stock options) are implemented differently in different countries.

*Disclaimer*: This is not tax advice, I am not a lawyer, go consult a professional, yada yada.

If you're not familiar with Canadian tax law here's a few simplified points that you should know:
1. You pay income tax when you exercise your vested options:

When you exercise your options for shares, you pay the strike price for the options and gain shares. The shares will probably have a higher current market value than the strike price you paid for it, so the difference (your gain per share) is counted as **income** by the government. Taxed as regular income.

2. You pay capital gains tax when you sell your shares:

Once you've exercised your options and have shares in hand, you can sell them for a profit. Any profit made here is **capital gains**, which in Canada is taxed at 50% your regular marginal rate.

So knowing these two things, my initial assumption is that the best strategy would be to exercise (options -> shares) as early as possible and sell (shares -> cash) as late as possible. This would result in the most time spent as shares, and the most profit inside the 'capital gains' bucket, rather than the 'income' bucket. Capital gains is taxed at a lower rate, so huzzah, you pay less taxes and keep more money. Easy peasy, right?

Well, yes and no. This is where it gets a bit interesting.

If you're exercising options of a large publicly traded company, it's possible that you don't have the cash you would need to exercise in the first place. You need to pay the strike price after all (for each share) *and* you owe regular income tax on the gain you just made, even if all that money is stored in an investment account as a share. So what do you do? You sell some of the shares you just exercised to cover the costs. This is pretty basic, and a lot of people do this. I'm not sure what most people do, but let's assume you can sell a portion of your shares to cover both the exercise cost and the taxes owed. This leaves you with less shares, but your costs and taxes are dealt with.

Ex: You exercise 100 shares at $10 strike each. Value is $20 each, so you made $10 of income ($1000 total). Your tax rate is 20% so you owe $200. Your exercise cost was $1000 + the $200 for taxes, so you sell 60 shares at $20 to pay it. You're left with 40 shares at $20 each, no more taxes owed.

You might have realised that any further gain in share price is for less shares. So let's revise the strategy a little: maybe there's a % gain point where it actually makes sense to *not* exercise early, keep as many stocks (as options) on hand to experience the gain in full. Maybe that point is where the gain from the additional shares makes up for the additional taxes incurred.

So I did some math to check and found out that, as far as I could tell, you always ended up with more net money if you exercised as late as possible (and sold immediately after exercise). (**Not tax advice**) I played with the numbers as much as I could, setting massive gains, or no gains, high strike prices or low strike prices, etc, and no matter what I could come up with, you always made more money in column B (exercising late, selling immediately) vs column A (exercising early, selling late). In fact, it looked like you'd pay more taxes, sometimes significantly more, but it didn't matter, you'd also end up with more takehome.

So that's the interesting tidbit for today. Here's an example of the math I did below, let me know if I went wrong somewhere (I'm genuinely curious).
