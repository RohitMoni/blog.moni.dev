title: "Planning: Things you don't know"
---

There's this phrase of "There are known knowns" from Donald Rumsfeld and the statement that followed it, but I like to re-phrase the concept into:
1. There are things you know that you know
2. There are things you know that you don't know
3. There are things you don't know that you know
4. There are things you don't know that you don't know

**The 4th part (What you don't know that you don't know) is the most dangerous when it comes to planning anything**. It's something that, by its very nature, you can't accurately account for. So we want to try and minimise it as much as we can and have a buffer of time just in case.

To illustrate this, I'll use the example of planning a family dinner. You're in charge and you need to make sure all the relevant dishes are prepared, etc.

One of the dishes is a potato dish. You know exactly how to make it and it'll be perfect; you've made it a dozen times before. This is something you know that you know (1). You can plan it exactly, it'll take you 20 minutes start to finish.

Another dish is the turkey. You've never done a whole turkey before and you're not sure how to do it. This is something you know that you don't know (2). Maybe you ask another family member for help with this, someone who has more experience with it. They tell you to defrost the turkey the right number of days before the big day. You plan with their timeline and all is good.

The third dish is a sauce. You've never made one before but as you get started you realise you've seen other people do it and you figure it out as you go along. It's better than expected and you make it pretty quickly, all things considered. This is something that you didn't know that you know (3). 

As the big day comes along and all the dishes are put on the table, suddenly someone chimes up that there should be cranberry sauce with this. Who forgot the cranberry sauce?! Now you have to scramble: you didn't even think about cranberry sauce. You have no cranberries. The nearest grocery store is a 30 minute drive roundtrip and it's also a big public holiday, so they might be closed. Either you drive to the store as quick as you can and delay everything or make do without the cranberry sauce. This is something you didn't know that you didn't know (4).

All of these can be seen when planning anything, from family dinners to large software releases. Things we don't know that we don't know end up with delays or cuts, which are both are disruptive and anxiety inducing. There's no good option here. **Good planning would a) minimise the number of things that fall under this as much as possible and b) have extra time for things you missed anyway.**
