    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;ve started blogs a few different times and have shut them all down. As they say, if at first you don&#39;t succeed, try, try again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think that I&#39;ll do better this time. I have lots to think about and writing is probably the best way to really organize and concretize my thoughts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Blogging is also something I think I&#39;d be interested in doing when I&#39;m bored. Will write about why I&#39;m probably going to be bored a lot as another post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a tentative, maybe too ambitious goal: I want to write about something once a week, every week, for 2025.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Time to get started.&lt;/p&gt;
